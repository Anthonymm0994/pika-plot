# ID Conflict Fix Summary

## Problem
When importing multiple CSV files in the file configuration dialog, egui was showing ID conflict warnings for various widgets. These warnings appeared as red text overlays on the UI:
- Table ID F835
- ScrollArea ID FC78  
- widget ID 0E74

## Root Cause
Multiple instances of the same widgets were being created without unique IDs. When rendering multiple files, each file's widgets (checkboxes, text edits, radio buttons, etc.) had the same implicit IDs, causing conflicts.

## Solution
The initial approach using `push_id` was incorrect for egui 0.28. Instead, the solution was to:

### 1. Remove push_id wrapper patterns
The `push_id` method creates a new scope but doesn't directly apply to individual widgets. Removed all push_id wrappers that were incorrectly applied.

### 2. Add id_source to TableBuilder instances
```rust
TableBuilder::new(ui)
    .id_source(format!("column_table_{}", file_idx))
    // ... rest of configuration
```

```rust
TableBuilder::new(ui)
    .id_source(format!("data_preview_{}", self.current_file_index))
    // ... rest of configuration
```

### 3. Use existing id_source on ScrollArea widgets
ScrollArea widgets in data_sources.rs and properties.rs already had proper id_source calls:
```rust
ScrollArea::vertical()
    .id_source("data_sources_table_list")
```

### 4. ComboBox widgets already had proper IDs
ComboBox widgets were already using from_id_source correctly:
```rust
egui::ComboBox::from_id_source(format!("type_{}_{}", file_idx, row_index))
```

## Additional Fixes
While fixing the ID conflicts, also restored important functionality:
1. **Primary Key Logic**: Restored checkbox logic ensuring only one column can be marked as primary key
2. **Header Row Change Detection**: Restored change detection for automatic preview reload
3. **Code Simplification**: Removed unnecessary variable tracking and simplified the UI code

## Result
All egui ID conflict warnings have been resolved. The file configuration dialog now works correctly when importing multiple CSV files, with all functionality preserved.
