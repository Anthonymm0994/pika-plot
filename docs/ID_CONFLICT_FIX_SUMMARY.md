# ID Conflict Fix Summary

## Problem
When importing multiple CSV files in Pika-Plot, egui was throwing ID conflict warnings. The issue was that multiple instances of the same widgets (particularly tables and scroll areas) were being created without unique IDs.

## Solution Applied

### ✅ Final Working Solution
The ID conflicts were resolved by implementing comprehensive unique IDs for ALL widgets in the FileConfigScreen:

1. **Wrapped all tables in unique scopes**:
   - Column selection table: `ui.push_id(format!("column_table_{}", file_idx), ...)`
   - Data preview table: `ui.push_id(format!("data_preview_table_{}", self.current_file_index), ...)`

2. **Added unique IDs to interactive widgets**:
   - Checkboxes: `ui.push_id(row_index, ...)` for include checkbox
   - Radio buttons: `ui.push_id(format!("pk_{}_{}", file_idx, row_index), ...)` for primary key
   - ComboBoxes: `.from_id_source(format!("type_combo_{}_{}", file_idx, row_index))`
   - Other checkboxes: Unique IDs based on purpose and row index

3. **Wrapped UI sections**:
   - Main UI: `ui.push_id("file_config_main", ...)`
   - Left column: `columns[0].push_id("left_column", ...)`
   - Right column: `columns[1].push_id("right_column", ...)`
   - Null values section: `ui.push_id(format!("null_values_{}", idx), ...)`
   - Delimiter section: `ui.push_id(format!("delimiter_{}", idx), ...)`

4. **Key Implementation Details**:
   - Used `ui.scope()` and `ui.push_id()` to create unique ID contexts
   - Each widget gets a unique ID based on its purpose and position
   - File index and row index are used to ensure uniqueness across multiple files
   - Removed default primary key selection for ID columns

### Additional Fixes Applied

5. **Fixed file switching crash**:
   - Changed from `selectable_value` to `selectable_label` in the file dropdown
   - Added bounds checking when accessing files array
   - Properly handle file preview loading after selection

6. **Added header row highlighting**:
   - First row in data preview is highlighted when header_row=1
   - Uses blue colored bold text to distinguish header from data
   - Implemented with `RichText::new(cell).strong().color(Color32::from_rgb(120, 200, 255))`

### Why This Solution Works
- Every widget has a unique ID based on its context (file index, row index, purpose)
- Tables are wrapped in unique scopes preventing internal ScrollArea conflicts
- The hierarchical ID structure ensures no conflicts even with multiple files
- Using format strings with indices guarantees uniqueness
- File switching is handled safely with proper bounds checking

## Result
✅ All egui ID conflict warnings are resolved
✅ File switching works without crashes
✅ Data preview displays correctly with header highlighting
✅ All functionality preserved
✅ No primary key is selected by default

The application now handles multiple CSV imports cleanly without any ID conflict warnings or crashes.
