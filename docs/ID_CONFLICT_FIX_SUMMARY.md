# ID Conflict Fix Summary

## Problem
When importing multiple CSV files in Pika-Plot, egui was throwing ID conflict warnings. The issue was that multiple instances of the same widgets (particularly tables and scroll areas) were being created without unique IDs.

## Solution Applied

### ✅ Successful Fix
The issue was resolved by restructuring the FileConfigScreen implementation to avoid ID conflicts:

1. **Removed problematic push_id wrappers** - The nested push_id calls were causing more problems than they solved
2. **Fixed borrow checker issues** - Restructured code to avoid double mutable borrows
3. **Added proper bounds checking** - Ensured current_file_index is always valid
4. **Fixed preview loading** - Separated data loading from UI update logic

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Removed instance_id usage** - The unique instance ID approach wasn't necessary and was complicating the code

2. **Fixed file switching logic**:
   - Added bounds checking before accessing files array
   - Load preview data when switching between files
   - Handle the preview loading after the ComboBox is closed to avoid borrow issues

3. **Separated concerns**:
   - Created standalone `infer_column_type` function
   - Created `load_preview_data` method that returns Result instead of mutating state
   - Inline column updates to avoid borrow checker issues

4. **Fixed defaults**:
   - Primary key is no longer set by default for ID columns
   - Boolean type inference was added

## Testing Steps

1. Open Pika-Plot
2. Click "Data" in left panel
3. Import multiple CSV files
4. Switch between files using the dropdown
5. Verify no red ID conflict warnings appear
6. Verify data preview shows correctly
7. Verify you can configure columns for each file

## Result
✅ ID conflicts are resolved
✅ File switching works without crashes
✅ Data preview displays correctly
✅ No primary key is selected by default

The application now handles multiple CSV imports cleanly without any ID conflict warnings.
