# ID Conflict Fix Summary

## Problem
When importing multiple CSV files in the file configuration dialog, egui was showing ID conflict warnings for various widgets. These warnings appeared as red text overlays on the UI:
- Table ID F835
- ScrollArea ID FC78  
- widget ID 0E74

## Root Cause
Multiple instances of the same widgets were being created without unique IDs. When rendering multiple files, each file's widgets (checkboxes, text edits, radio buttons, etc.) had the same implicit IDs, causing conflicts.

## Solution
The initial approaches didn't work because:
1. `push_id` method doesn't directly apply to individual widgets in the way we were trying
2. `TableBuilder` in egui_extras 0.28 doesn't have an `id_source` method
3. `ScrollArea` in egui 0.28 doesn't have an `id_salt` method (only `id_source`)

The final solution was to:

### 1. Add a unique instance ID to FileConfigScreen
```rust
pub struct FileConfigScreen {
    // ... other fields
    instance_id: egui::Id,
}

impl FileConfigScreen {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            // ... other fields
            instance_id: egui::Id::new("file_config_instance").with(std::time::SystemTime::now()),
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Use instance_id in push_id wrappers
Wrap the entire CentralPanel content and specific sections with push_id using the unique instance ID:
```rust
ui.push_id(self.instance_id.with("file_config_screen"), |ui| {
    // ... entire UI content
});
```

### 3. Wrap table sections with unique contexts
```rust
ui.push_id(self.instance_id.with("column_table_section"), |ui| {
    self.render_column_table(ui, idx);
});

ui.push_id(self.instance_id.with("data_preview_section"), |ui| {
    TableBuilder::new(ui)
        // ... table configuration
});
```

### 4. Keep existing working IDs
- ComboBox widgets already using `from_id_source` correctly
- ScrollArea widgets in panels already using `id_source` correctly

## Why This Works
1. The `instance_id` uses `SystemTime::now()` to ensure each FileConfigScreen instance has a globally unique ID
2. Using `push_id` with this unique ID creates a unique context for all child widgets
3. Additional `push_id` calls for specific sections provide extra isolation
4. This ensures that even if the same screen is rendered multiple times, each instance has unique widget IDs

## Result
All egui ID conflict warnings have been resolved. The file configuration dialog now works correctly when importing multiple CSV files, with all functionality preserved. The solution is robust and will prevent ID conflicts even if multiple instances of the screen are created.
