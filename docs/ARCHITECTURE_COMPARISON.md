# Architecture Comparison: Current Implementation vs Node Graph Crates

## Current Implementation Analysis

### What We Have
- Custom canvas system built from scratch
- Basic node types (Table, Plot, Note, Shape)
- Node dragging, resizing, and selection
- Context menus for node creation
- Performance optimizations (frustum culling, grid caching)
- Query editor in table nodes
- Basic connection drawing (but incomplete creation flow)

### Strengths
- Full control over implementation
- Tailored to our specific use case
- Already integrated with our data pipeline
- Good performance optimizations
- Clean separation of concerns

### Weaknesses
- Connection creation is incomplete
- No pin/port system for connections
- Limited wire interaction (can't drag wires)
- No built-in serialization
- Missing many standard features (undo/redo, copy/paste)
- Significant development effort for basic features

## Evaluated Node Graph Crates

### 1. egui-snarl (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Actively maintained (latest release Feb 2025)
- Feature-complete node editor
- Beautiful bezier wire rendering
- Built-in serialization support
- Pin system with custom UI per pin
- Context menus for nodes and background
- Multiconnection support (Shift+drag)
- Wire yanking (Ctrl+drag)
- Configurable styles and themes
- Good examples and documentation

**Cons:**
- Would require refactoring our node types
- Learning curve for the API
- Less control over internals

**Integration Effort:** Medium
- Need to implement SnarlViewer trait
- Map our node types to Snarl's system
- Adapt our data flow logic

### 2. egui_node_graph (Archived)
**Pros:**
- Was very popular and well-designed
- Good architecture patterns

**Cons:**
- Archived repository (no longer maintained)
- Outdated egui version

**Verdict:** Not recommended due to being unmaintained

### 3. egui_nodes
**Pros:**
- Simple and lightweight
- Easy to understand

**Cons:**
- Very basic functionality
- No advanced features we need
- Less maintained

**Verdict:** Too basic for our needs

### 4. egui_graphs
**Pros:**
- Good for graph visualization
- Force-directed layouts

**Cons:**
- Focused on graph visualization, not node editors
- Different use case than ours

**Verdict:** Wrong tool for our use case

## Recommendation: Adopt egui-snarl

### Migration Plan

#### Phase 1: Proof of Concept
1. Create a separate example using egui-snarl
2. Implement our node types with SnarlViewer
3. Test data flow between nodes
4. Evaluate performance and usability

#### Phase 2: Integration
1. Add egui-snarl as dependency
2. Create adapter layer for our existing node types
3. Implement custom pin UIs for:
   - Data preview pins
   - Query editor pins
   - Plot configuration pins
4. Migrate connection logic to use Snarl's wire system

#### Phase 3: Feature Enhancement
1. Leverage Snarl's serialization for save/load
2. Implement custom node templates
3. Add advanced features:
   - Node grouping
   - Sub-graphs
   - Custom wire routing

### Benefits of Migration

1. **Immediate Features**
   - Complete connection system
   - Wire interactions
   - Serialization
   - Better UX patterns

2. **Development Speed**
   - Focus on our domain logic, not UI primitives
   - Benefit from community improvements
   - Reduced maintenance burden

3. **Professional Polish**
   - Battle-tested interactions
   - Consistent behavior
   - Better accessibility

### Risks and Mitigation

1. **Risk:** Loss of custom optimizations
   - **Mitigation:** Profile and contribute optimizations upstream

2. **Risk:** API limitations
   - **Mitigation:** egui-snarl exposes internals, allowing customization

3. **Risk:** Migration complexity
   - **Mitigation:** Incremental migration with adapter pattern

## Alternative: Enhance Current Implementation

If we decide to keep our implementation:

### Required Improvements
1. Complete connection creation flow
2. Add pin/port system for connections
3. Implement wire dragging and editing
4. Add undo/redo system
5. Implement copy/paste
6. Add serialization
7. Improve wire rendering
8. Add node templates

### Estimated Effort
- Connection system completion: 2-3 days
- Pin/port system: 3-4 days
- Undo/redo: 2-3 days
- Serialization: 1-2 days
- Total: 2-3 weeks of development

## Conclusion

While our current implementation has a solid foundation, adopting egui-snarl would provide immediate access to professional-grade node editor features. The migration effort (1 week) is less than implementing missing features ourselves (2-3 weeks), and we'd benefit from ongoing community development.

The recommendation is to adopt egui-snarl while keeping our performance optimizations and domain-specific logic intact.
