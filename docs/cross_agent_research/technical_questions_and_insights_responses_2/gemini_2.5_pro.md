Excellent. This is a mature and highly relevant set of questions that moves beyond architecture into production-grade engineering. As Gemini 2.5 Pro, I will again provide focused, practical answers for the areas where my systems-level expertise is most applicable.

My selections for this round are:
1.  **Testing Strategy Questions (GPU & DuckDB)**
2.  **Data Streaming Architecture**
3.  **Windows-Specific Concerns (File System)**

### **1. Technical Response: Testing Strategy Questions**

#### **GPU Testing Without Hardware**

**Core Principle:** Your goal is not to mock the entire GPU but to test your *logic against the GPU API contract*. We can test different layers in isolation.

1.  **Mocking `wgpu::Device` and `wgpu::Queue`:** Don't do it. A full mock implementation would be an enormous undertaking and would likely make incorrect assumptions about the API's behavior. Instead, test against a real, software-based backend.

2.  **`wgpu::Backends::PRIMARY` with Software Rendering:** **Yes, this is the correct approach.** Modern CI environments can use software renderers like `lavapipe` (for Vulkan) or Mesa's `llvmpipe` (for OpenGL) that implement the full graphics API on the CPU.
    *   **CI Setup:** In your GitHub Actions workflow, install the Mesa drivers and `lavapipe` before running your tests. Set the environment variable `VK_ICD_FILENAMES` to point to the `lavapipe_icd.x86_64.json` file.
    *   **`wgpu::Instance::new(wgpu::Backends::VULKAN)`**: When this runs in CI, it will pick up `lavapipe` and give you a fully compliant, albeit slow, `wgpu::Device`. This tests your API usage, resource creation, and pipeline state setup correctly.

3.  **Testing Memory Pressure:** You `cannot` test actual VRAM pressure. Instead, you test your *application's response* to simulated pressure.
    *   **Simulated Pressure:** Create a mock `MemoryMonitor` trait that your real monitor implements. In tests, use a mock implementation that can be programmatically set to "high pressure."
    *   **Test Logic:** Write tests that assert your `GpuResourceManager` and `CacheCoordinator` correctly evict buffers and drop resources when the mock monitor reports high pressure. You are testing your application's logic, not the hardware's behavior.

4.  **Testing Shader Compilation Errors:** This is crucial and straightforward.
    *   Pass deliberately invalid WGSL code to `device.create_shader_module()`.
    *   Use `device.on_uncaptured_error()` to set up a callback that receives shader compilation errors.
    *   Assert that your callback receives an error and that your UI correctly falls back or displays an error toast, rather than panicking.

5.  **Separate Test Harness:** **Yes.** Use Cargo's test target features. Tag your hardware-dependent tests with an attribute.

    ```rust
    #[test]
    #[cfg_attr(not(feature = "gpu_tests"), ignore)]
    fn test_render_1m_points_on_real_gpu() {
        // ... test logic ...
    }
    ```
    In CI, you run `cargo test --workspace`. On your dedicated test machine, you run `cargo test --workspace --features gpu_tests`.

**Specific Code Example (`GpuDevice` trait):**

My previous advice to *not mock* stands. The trait adds abstraction that isn't necessary if you use a software backend. However, if you must, here is the clean way to do it using `mockall`. This is primarily for testing your *application logic's interaction* with the renderer, not the renderer itself.

```rust
// Install mockall: cargo add mockall --dev
use mockall::mock;

// The trait you asked for
pub trait GpuDevice {
    fn create_buffer(&self, desc: &wgpu::BufferDescriptor) -> u32; // Return a mock ID
}

// mockall will auto-generate a MockGpuDevice for you
mock! {
    pub GpuDevice {}
    impl GpuDevice for GpuDevice {
        fn create_buffer(&self, desc: &wgpu::BufferDescriptor) -> u32;
    }
}

#[test]
fn test_resource_manager_creates_buffer_on_new_plot() {
    let mut mock_device = MockGpuDevice::new();
    
    // Expect the create_buffer method to be called exactly once
    mock_device.expect_create_buffer()
        .times(1)
        .returning(|_| 123); // Return a mock buffer ID

    // Your resource manager now takes a `Box<dyn GpuDevice>`
    let mut manager = GpuResourceManager::new(Box::new(mock_device));
    manager.add_plot(NodeId::new());
}
```

#### **DuckDB Integration Testing**

1.  **In-memory vs. On-disk:** Use **in-memory databases for 99% of tests.** It's faster, requires no cleanup, and guarantees test isolation. Only use on-disk fixtures for tests that specifically deal with file I/O, persistence, or snapshot loading/recreation logic. (`duckdb::Connection::open_in_memory()?`)

2.  **Testing Long-Running Queries:** The goal is not to make tests fast by avoiding the query, but to test the behavior *during* the query.
    *   Use a smaller, but still non-trivial, dataset in fixtures (`medium.csv`).
    *   In tests that check for UI responsiveness or cancellation, run a query that's designed to take a predictable amount of time (e.g., a `CROSS JOIN` to generate millions of rows). You can then test that your `JoinHandle::abort()` logic works correctly.
    *   **Never add `thread::sleep` to simulate work.**

3.  **Mocking Progress Callbacks:** You don't need to mock them. You test the full loop.
    1.  Create a real `tokio::mpsc` channel in your test.
    2.  Pass the `sender` half to your `execute_query_with_progress` function.
    3.  In the test, `await` the query's completion while simultaneously using `tokio::time::timeout` to try and `recv()` from the `receiver` half.
    4.  Assert that you received progress update messages on the channel before the query finished.

4.  **Trait Abstraction over DuckDB:** **No.** This is an anti-pattern when dealing with a concrete, powerful dependency. You will end up re-implementing a watered-down version of DuckDB's API as a trait, losing access to its specific features. Instead, write test helpers that encapsulate DuckDB setup.

5.  **Testing Concurrent R/W:** DuckDB's standard Rust connection is `!Send + !Sync` and represents a single serial connection. For concurrency, DuckDB recommends opening multiple connections to the same database file. Your tests can do exactly this: open two connections (one read-only, one read-write) to the same temporary on-disk database and have two `tokio::spawn` tasks interact with them to test for locking behavior or data visibility.

### **2. Technical Response: Data Streaming Architecture**

**Core Principle:** DuckDB is exceptional at managing larger-than-RAM data on disk ("spilling"). Your application's job is not to re-implement this, but to act as a smart, memory-aware consumer of the data streams DuckDB provides.

1.  **Custom Iterators vs. DuckDB Spilling:** **Rely entirely on DuckDB's spilling mechanism.** Attempting to build a custom streaming layer on top of a database that already does this expertly is a path to immense complexity and bugs. Configure DuckDB's memory limit (`SET memory_limit='12GB'`) and let it handle writing intermediate results to temp files on disk. Your `DataStream` is then a client that pulls batches from this managed process.

2.  **Coordinating Memory Limits:** This is the job of the `MemoryCoordinator`.
    *   DuckDB's memory limit should be set to a large, but fixed, fraction of the system's "budget" (e.g., 50% of the 75% total budget).
    *   Your application's caches (query results, GPU buffers) use the remaining budget.
    *   When your application's caches are full and need to evict data, they do so. DuckDB's memory usage is its own concern; you manage your application's memory. When DuckDB needs more memory than its limit, it will spill to disk. Your app doesn't need to tell it to do so.

3.  **Progressive Loading in the UI:** Your `stream_query_results` example is the foundation. The UI receives batches and appends them to a growing client-side representation.
    *   For plots, the first batch is used to render a low-resolution version immediately. As more batches arrive, the GPU aggregation kernel can be re-run with the larger dataset, progressively refining the plot. This provides excellent perceived performance.
    *   The key is that the UI must be ableto handle receiving batches over time and trigger redraws/recomputes accordingly.

4.  **Tiled Rendering for Billions of Points:** This is the natural extension of the aggregation strategy. If a dataset is too large to even generate an aggregated texture in VRAM, you would query DuckDB with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses based on the user's viewport.
    *   The viewport is divided into tiles.
    *   For each visible tile, issue a bounded SQL query: `SELECT ... FROM huge_table WHERE x BETWEEN ... AND y BETWEEN ...`.
    *   Run the aggregation compute shader for each tile's data individually and render the resulting small texture.
    *   This is an advanced technique. Implement it only if you find that a single global aggregation texture is insufficient for your largest target datasets.

5.  **Handling Backpressure:** The `tokio::mpsc::channel` has a bounded buffer. When you create it, you give it a capacity (e.g., 16).
    *   If the data stream from DuckDB is producing batches faster than the UI thread can process them (e.g., create GPU buffers), the `batch_tx.send(batch).await` call in the engine thread will naturally pause (yield) until there is space in the channel buffer.
    *   This provides automatic, natural backpressure. The engine will not run away and exhaust all memory producing batches that the UI can't handle. A small channel buffer (e.g., 4-8) is usually sufficient.

**Example `DataStream` Architecture:**

Your `DataStream` trait is good, but in practice, you won't implement it yourself. You'll be using `duckdb::ArrowArrayStreamReader`, which is effectively DuckDB's implementation of that trait.

```rust
// The UI gets this from the engine
pub enum DataResult {
    // For small results that fit in RAM
    Complete(Arc<RecordBatch>), 
    // For large results that must be streamed
    Stream(tokio::sync::mpsc::Receiver<Result<RecordBatch, PikaError>>),
}

// UI-side logic
async fn handle_data_result(result: DataResult) {
    match result {
        DataResult::Complete(batch) => {
            // Process the full dataset at once
        }
        DataResult::Stream(mut rx) => {
            // Process batches as they arrive
            while let Some(batch_result) = rx.recv().await {
                let batch = batch_result?;
                // Update plot with the new batch...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### **3. Technical Response: Windows-Specific Concerns (File System)**

**Core Principle:** Windows file handling has sharp edges. Use a crate that normalizes this behavior for you.

1.  **UNC & Long Path Support:** Long paths (`>260` chars) require the `\\?\` prefix. Trying to manage this manually is error-prone.
    *   **Solution:** Use the `dunce` crate. It provides a `canonicalize` function that correctly resolves paths and applies the `\\?\` prefix on Windows when necessary, while being a no-op on other platforms. Always pass paths through `dunce::canonicalize` before handing them to file system APIs or DuckDB.

2.  **`\\?\` Prefix:** Yes, but don't do it yourself. Let `dunce` handle it.

3.  **File Locking (Open Excel Files):** When a user has a CSV open in Excel, Windows places a read-sharing lock on it. Your attempt to `File::open()` it for reading will fail with an access-denied error.
    *   **Detection:** This is standard `std::io::Error`. Match on `io::ErrorKind::PermissionDenied`.
    *   **UX:** When you detect this error, display a user-friendly toast: "Error: `sales.csv` is locked by another program (likely Excel). Please close it and try again."
    *   **Proactive Check (Advanced):** There is no foolproof way to check for a lock without trying to open the file. However, for a polished UX, you could try to open the file *with read-sharing enabled yourself* when the user selects it, before they click "Import". This allows you to give instant feedback.

4.  **Case-Insensitive File Systems:** This is a classic source of bugs. The user might have `Data.csv` and `data.csv` in the same directory on a Linux system, then try to open that workspace on Windows.
    *   **Solution:** On startup and whenever file paths are resolved, **canonicalize them to their true on-disk casing.** Windows APIs can provide this. More simply, when you resolve a path, always use a case-**insensitive** comparison for lookups within your application's internal state (e.g., in your snapshot's `DataSourceRef` map) but store the canonical, cased path provided by the OS. Never perform case-sensitive string comparisons on file paths on Windows.

5.  **Windows Path Completion:** For the CLI, a crate like `clap_complete_fig` can generate completion scripts for various shells, including PowerShell on Windows, which handles path completion automatically. This is the idiomatic way to support it.
