# Technical Questions and Insights - Round 5: Implementation Specifics

## Overview

This document contains specific implementation questions that have arisen from the current codebase. These are concrete challenges that need solutions to move forward with the implementation.

## 1. Arrow-DuckDB Integration Issues (Priority: CRITICAL)

**Assigned to: Gemini 2.5 Pro**

### The Problem
We're facing version conflicts between Arrow crates and DuckDB's arrow re-export. When trying to use arrow 50.0, 48.0, 46.0, or 42.0, we get compilation errors related to chrono traits.

### Specific Questions

1. **Version Resolution**
   ```toml
   # This causes conflicts:
   arrow = "50.0"
   duckdb = { version = "0.10", features = ["bundled", "arrow"] }
   
   # Error: trait bound `chrono::DateTime<Tz>: ArrowNativeType` not satisfied
   ```
   - Which exact arrow version is compatible with duckdb 0.10?
   - Should we use duckdb's re-exported arrow types exclusively?
   - How do we handle the feature flag conflicts?

2. **Zero-Copy Pattern**
   ```rust
   // Current attempt:
   use duckdb::arrow::record_batch::RecordBatch;
   
   // But we need to convert to GPU buffers
   // How do we access raw data pointers safely?
   ```

### Deliverable Needed
```rust
// File: pika-engine/src/database/arrow_bridge.rs
// Working implementation that:
// 1. Correctly uses duckdb's arrow types
// 2. Provides zero-copy access to buffers
// 3. Handles all numeric types we need
// 4. Includes tests that actually compile
```

## 2. GPU Buffer Lifetime Management (Priority: CRITICAL)

**Assigned to: Claude Opus 4**

### The Problem
Our `TrackedBuffer` needs to coordinate with the `MemoryCoordinator`, but we have lifetime issues with async operations.

### Specific Questions

1. **Async Drop Pattern**
   ```rust
   // Current TrackedBuffer uses sync Drop
   impl Drop for TrackedBuffer {
       fn drop(&mut self) {
           // This needs to notify MemoryCoordinator
           // But coordinator operations are async
       }
   }
   ```
   - How do we handle async cleanup in Drop?
   - Should we use a different pattern (RAII guard)?

2. **Buffer Pooling**
   - Should we implement buffer pooling for common sizes?
   - How do we handle fragmentation?
   - What's the overhead of wgpu buffer creation?

### Deliverable Needed
Complete implementation of GPU buffer lifecycle management that integrates with our memory coordinator.

## 3. Event System Architecture (Priority: HIGH)

**Assigned to: All Agents**

### The Problem
We have `broadcast::channel` for events but need to handle:
- Backpressure for progress events
- Priority for cancellation events  
- Event ordering guarantees

### Specific Questions

1. **Channel Architecture**
   ```rust
   // Current: single broadcast channel
   pub struct Engine {
       event_tx: broadcast::Sender<AppEvent>,
   }
   
   // Do we need multiple channels?
   // Priority queue for events?
   // Bounded vs unbounded?
   ```

2. **Progress Event Throttling**
   - How do we prevent progress spam?
   - Should we batch progress updates?
   - Time-based or count-based throttling?

### Deliverable Needed
```rust
// File: pika-core/src/events/system.rs
// Complete event system with:
// - Priority handling
// - Throttling
// - Cancellation propagation
// - Tests showing behavior under load
```

## 4. Shader Compilation Caching (Priority: HIGH)

**Assigned to: Gemini 2.5 Pro & Claude Opus 4**

### The Problem
Shader compilation is expensive. We need a caching strategy.

### Specific Questions

1. **Cache Key Design**
   ```wgsl
   // Our shaders have dynamic constants
   struct Config {
       bin_count_x: u32,
       bin_count_y: u32,
       // ...
   }
   
   // Do we:
   // 1. Compile once with max values?
   // 2. Cache per configuration?
   // 3. Use specialization constants?
   ```

2. **Persistent Cache**
   - Should we cache compiled shaders to disk?
   - How do we handle driver updates?
   - What's the cache invalidation strategy?

### Deliverable Needed
Shader caching system with benchmarks showing compilation time savings.

## 5. Testing Async + GPU Code (Priority: HIGH)

**Assigned to: Claude Opus 4**

### The Problem
Testing code that combines async Rust with GPU operations is complex.

### Specific Code Pattern
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_gpu_aggregation() {
    // Need to:
    // 1. Create GPU device (might fail in CI)
    // 2. Run async operation
    // 3. Wait for GPU completion
    // 4. Verify results
    
    // But how do we make this deterministic?
}
```

### Specific Questions

1. **Test Harness Design**
   - How do we mock time for progress tests?
   - Should we use `tokio::time::pause()`?
   - How to test timeout behavior?

2. **GPU Mock vs Software Rendering**
   - When to use our MockGpuDevice?
   - When to use lavapipe?
   - How to test both paths?

### Deliverable Needed
Complete test harness with examples for common patterns.

## 6. DuckDB Connection Pool (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Assigned to: Any Agent**

### The Problem
DuckDB connections are `!Send + !Sync`. How do we manage them efficiently?

### Current Attempt
```rust
pub struct Database {
    path: String,
    // Can't use a pool of connections directly
}
```

### Questions

1. **Connection Management**
   - One connection per thread?
   - Queue of connection requests?
   - Actor pattern with single connection?

2. **Concurrent Access**
   - How to handle concurrent reads?
   - Write serialization strategy?
   - Transaction management?

### Deliverable Needed
Working connection management system with benchmarks.

## 7. Plot Rendering Pipeline (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Assigned to: GPT-4.5 & Grok 4**

### The Problem
We need to integrate egui with wgpu for plot rendering, but egui uses its own rendering.

### Specific Integration Points
```rust
// How do we:
// 1. Render plots with wgpu
// 2. Composite with egui UI
// 3. Handle plot interactions
// 4. Maintain 60 FPS
```

### Questions

1. **Rendering Architecture**
   - Render to texture then display in egui?
   - Direct wgpu rendering with egui overlay?
   - Separate windows?

2. **Interaction Handling**
   - How to handle mouse events on plots?
   - Coordinate spaces conversion?
   - Selection rendering?

### Deliverable Needed

## 8. Workspace Snapshot Format (Priority: LOW)

**Assigned to: Any Agent**

### The Problem
Our snapshot format needs to handle:
- Binary data (GPU buffers)
- SQL queries
- UI state
- File references

### Current Structure
```rust
pub struct Snapshot {
    version: u32,
    nodes: Vec<NodeSnapshot>,
    // How to handle binary data?
}
```

### Questions

1. **Serialization Format**
   - RON for metadata + separate binary files?
   - Single zip archive?
   - SQLite database?

2. **Versioning Strategy**
   - How to migrate old snapshots?
   - Partial loading support?
   - Corruption recovery?

### Deliverable Needed

## 9. Memory Pressure Simulation (Priority: LOW)

**Assigned to: Any Agent**

### For Testing
We need to simulate memory pressure scenarios for testing our eviction logic.

### Approaches to Research

1. **OS-Level Simulation**
   - Can we use Windows job objects?
   - Memory allocation tricks?
   - External pressure tool?

2. **Application-Level**
   - Artificial memory consumers?
   - Mock memory coordinator?
   - Configurable limits?

### Deliverable Needed
Testing utilities for memory pressure scenarios.

## 10. Performance Profiling Integration (Priority: LOW)

**Assigned to: Gemini 2.5 Pro**

### The Problem
We need built-in profiling that doesn't slow down the application.

### Specific Requirements

1. **GPU Timeline Events**
   ```rust
   // Need to insert markers:
   gpu_profiler.begin_event("aggregation");
   // ... GPU work ...
   gpu_profiler.end_event();
   ```

2. **Correlation with CPU Events**
   - How to align GPU/CPU timelines?
   - Unified event stream?
   - Export format?

### Deliverable Needed
