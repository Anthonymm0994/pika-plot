### Questions Requiring Deep Analysis

  1. Basic atomic version (current)
  2. Tile-based with shared memory
  3. Multi-pass reduction version
  4. Hybrid approach

  * 1M, 10M, 100M, and 1B points
  * Different data distributions (uniform, gaussian, clustered)
  * Bin resolutions from 256x256 up to 4096x4096

## ðŸ’¡ Additional Model-Initiated Questions & Prompts

**Prompted by Claude Opus 4**

1. If GPU optimization proves fragile or hard to maintain, can we identify a fallback that mirrors what Rerun doesâ€”fast GPU rendering with fewer shaders and less aggressive binning? What tradeoffs would that entail?

2. Is it possible to offer multiple rendering backends, one optimized and one simplified? Could this be a launch parameter or a user setting?

3. Are there known WGSL libraries or shader frameworks we can incorporate or study?

4. What fallback debugging or simulation tools can be built now to simulate GPU logic on CPU?

5. Can any portions of this design be tested against Rerunâ€™s current renderer benchmarks to estimate feasibility?

6. Even if we proceed with deep GPU optimization, are there modular interfaces we can define now to allow easier rollback or experimentation later?

---

**Note from Project Lead:**

This architecture is already extremely deep. We are not against high-performance optimization, but we must remain practical. If simplified GPU-based rendering like Rerunâ€™s approach meets our core UX/performance goals with less complexity, we should strongly consider it. Please offer both paths when possible and help us stress-test assumptions before going too far in a difficult direction.
