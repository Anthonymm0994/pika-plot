# Pika-Plot Implementation Progress

## Current Status: Arrow Dependency Blocked

**Major Blocker**: Arrow-DuckDB version conflicts preventing compilation. The `arrow-arith` crate has trait conflicts with `chrono` that need resolution before we can proceed.

## Completed âœ…

### Core Architecture
- 5-crate workspace structure (pika-core, pika-engine, pika-ui, pika-app, pika-cli)
- Basic module structure for all crates
- Cross-agent research documented in `docs/cross_agent_research/`
- Created 5 rounds of technical questions for delegation:
  - Round 1: Architecture and consensus building
  - Round 2: Testing and production concerns
  - Round 3: Module-specific implementations
  - Round 4: Specialized research tasks
  - Round 5: Concrete implementation blockers

### pika-core
- Complete error taxonomy with user-friendly messages
- Core types (NodeId, Point2, ImportOptions, etc.)
- Event system for UI-Engine communication
- Plot configuration types
- Node trait and node type definitions
- Workspace mode and snapshot types
- **Windows file utilities module** with:
  - Path normalization using `dunce` crate (Gemini's recommendation)
  - File lock detection and retry logic
  - Case-insensitive file lookups
  - User-friendly error messages

### pika-engine
- Engine struct with event channels and memory coordinator integration
- Database module with DuckDB integration (pending arrow fix)
- Import module for CSV/Parquet/JSON (structure only)
- Query module with result handling (structure only)
- Cache module with memory pressure monitoring (80% threshold)
- Workspace module structure
- GPU module with 256-byte alignment and discrete GPU validation
- Aggregation module structure
- Mock GPU implementation for testing
- Data streaming trait for larger-than-memory datasets
- Integration tests framework
- Performance benchmarks structure
- **GPU shader infrastructure**:
  - Shader manager for loading WGSL modules
  - Basic aggregation_2d shader with 256 workgroup size
  - Placeholder shaders for density, min/max, histogram
- **TrackedDevice for GPU memory monitoring** (Gemini's pattern)
- **MemoryCoordinator** implementing Gemini's unified memory management:
  - Cost-based eviction strategy
  - Dynamic rebalancing between DuckDB and GPU
  - Eviction callbacks
  - Memory pressure monitoring
- **DuckDB streaming implementation** with:
  - Backpressure support via bounded channels
  - Progress reporting
  - Adaptive execution (stream vs complete)

### pika-ui
- Basic app structure with egui/eframe
- State management setup
- Module structure for panels and widgets
- **Widget implementations**:
  - Progress indicator with ETA calculation
  - Progress panel for multiple operations
  - Pan/zoom utilities for canvas widgets
  - Grid drawing helpers
  - Placeholder widgets for data table, node editor, plot config

### pika-cli
- Enhanced CLI with progress bars (indicatif)
- Multiple output formats (human, table, csv, json, jsonl)
- Configuration management
- Diagnostics command
- Memory size parsing (e.g., "4GB", "512MB")
- Quiet and verbose modes
- Global options support

### Documentation
- Comprehensive technical questions across 5 rounds
- Implementation patterns from agent consensus
- Clear delegation of work with expected deliverables

## Critical Blockers ðŸš¨

1. **Arrow-DuckDB Version Conflict**
   - Error: `multiple applicable items in scope` for chrono traits
   - Blocks all data processing functionality
   - Need solution from Gemini 2.5 Pro (assigned in round 5)

2. **Missing Dependencies in Cargo.toml**
   - Many crates referenced but not added
   - Need to add all dependencies once arrow issue resolved

## Next Steps (Once Unblocked)

1. **Resolve Arrow dependency** - Critical path
2. **Add all dependencies** to Cargo.toml files
3. **Fix compilation errors** and get basic build working
4. **Implement GPU shaders** based on agent responses
5. **Complete streaming implementation** for DuckDB
6. **Build basic UI** with plot rendering

## Dependencies Still Needed

```toml
# Core dependencies
duckdb = { version = "0.10", features = ["bundled"] } # Without arrow feature?
wgpu = "0.18"
egui = "0.24"
eframe = "0.24"
tokio = { version = "1.35", features = ["full"] }
uuid = { version = "1.6", features = ["v4", "serde"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
ron = "0.8"
anyhow = "1.0"
tracing = "0.1"
parking_lot = "0.12"
bytemuck = "1.14"

# CLI enhancements
indicatif = "0.17"
comfy-table = "7.0"
clap = { version = "4.4", features = ["derive"] }
num_cpus = "1.16"

# Testing
tempfile = "3.8"
criterion = { version = "0.5", features = ["async_tokio"] }
proptest = "1.4"

# Async traits
async-trait = "0.1"

# CSV handling
csv = "1.3"

# Progress and logging
tracing-subscriber = { version = "0.3", features = ["env-filter"] }

# Windows path handling
dunce = "1.0"

# System information
sys-info = "0.9"
```

## Current Architecture Strengths

1. **Clean separation of concerns** across 5 crates
2. **Comprehensive error handling** with user-friendly messages
3. **Memory management** with central coordinator
4. **Streaming architecture** for large datasets
5. **GPU abstraction** allowing CPU fallback
6. **Extensive test infrastructure** planned
7. **Windows-specific handling** throughout

## Areas Needing Agent Input

1. **Arrow-DuckDB resolution** (Gemini - Critical)
2. **GPU shader optimizations** (Gemini & Claude)
3. **Async testing patterns** (Claude)
4. **UI/UX patterns** (GPT-4.5 & Grok)
5. **Event system architecture** (All agents)
6. **Plot rendering pipeline** (GPT-4.5 & Grok)

The project has a solid foundation but needs the arrow dependency issue resolved before further progress can be made on the data processing pipeline.
