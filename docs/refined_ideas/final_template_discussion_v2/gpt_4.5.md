Here's a concise, thorough, and purely implementation-focused list of additional documents, diagrams, specifications, clarifications, structuring guidelines, and other inputs you must prepare clearly and precisely to enable full, confident automation agent-driven implementation of the provided **"final_template_plan_v2.md"** for Pika-Plot:

---

## 📚 Additional Documentation & Specifications Required

### 1. **Detailed API Contracts Between Crates**
- **Precise Trait & Method signatures:**
  - Exactly define methods for each trait in `pika-core` like:
    - Input/output for `Node::render(ui, ctx)`
    - Full specification of `AppEvent` variants with concrete field types & ownership semantics (use of `Arc`, references).
  - Event channel semantics:
    - Clarify event queue size, blocking behavior, backpressure handling, error handling.

### 2. **DuckDB Database Schema Conventions**
- **Schema Naming Conventions:**
  - Explicitly document CSV → DuckDB table naming rules (special characters, spaces, collisions).
- **Type inference rules:**
  - Concrete examples (sample CSV columns → detected DuckDB types)
  - Required precision for numeric/categorical columns (e.g. when to infer INTEGER vs FLOAT vs VARCHAR)
- **Implementation details for DuckDB FFI usage:**
  - Exactly what DuckDB functions to call (sql execution, parameter binding, stmt lifecycle)
  - Precise Rust FFI-safe bindings or crate choice documented.

### 3. **GPU Rendering Implementation Details**
- **Concrete GPU pipeline descriptions**:
  - Vertex layout formats (wgpu vertex buffers, instance buffers layouts, GPU buffer sizing & alignment for data)
  - Details for compute shaders:
    - Aggregation algorithm pseudocode or mathematical spec (exactly how to bin/react to zoom levels)
- **GPU data binding method** explicitly defined:
  - How and when data batches uploaded to GPU (frame-by-frame, background worker, lazy upload).

### 4. **Memory Management Policies**
- **Concrete Memory Limits:**
  - Specify numeric thresholds (MB or % RAM) that trigger degradation or warning behaviors.
- **Decision Matrix for Degradation:**
  - Explicit rules: "Above 90% → Fail operation, above 80% → Warn user but continue".
- **Clear Error Handling Contracts:**
  - Document all expected memory-related errors structures, including context and recovery.

### 5. **Workspace Snapshot File Format Spec**
- **RON schema specification** for workspace snapshots explicitly documented:
  - Complete RON structure (Nodes, connections serialized forms)
  - Data source referencing format (checksum algorithms, relative vs absolute paths).
- **Backward & forward compatibility plan:**
  - Document snapshot versioning scheme explicitly.

## 📈 Required Detailed Diagrams & Visual Specs

### 1. **Event Flow Diagrams (Fully Explicit)**
- Clear sequence diagrams illustrating UI ↔ Engine interactions for:
  - CSV import operation
  - Query execution operation
  - Data sampling & GPU data flow

### 2. **GPU Pipeline Diagrams**
- A detailed visual pipeline:
  - Vertex→fragment shader passes explicitly labeled.
  - Screenshots of expected intermediate GPU outputs (idealized mockups or prototypes if possible).
  - Clearly illustrate exactly which GPU operations run asynchronously, and on which threads/context.

### 3. **UI Interaction Wireframes**
- Notebook mode UI:
  - Exact UI states for cell editing, completion/error reporting UI flow
- Canvas mode UI:
  - Interactions define and visualize:
    - Drag-drop behavior (nodes, CSVs)
    - Connections/routing behavior clarity
- Explicit keyboard/mouse interaction specs for node manipulation clearly defined.

## 📌 Structuring the Implementation Environment

### 1. **Initial Rust Workspace Setup**
- Precise cargo workspace configuration: 
  - Ensure correct crate dependency graph explicitly mapped out (exact `Cargo.toml` for each crate)
  - Provide concrete dependencies and versions (ducktape, wgpu, egui versions explicitly locked down).

- Explicit folder structure scaffolding script or Makefile:
  - Clearly defined `build.rs` tasks for protobuf/RON or shader compilation.

### 2. **Task Management & Implementation Queue**
- An explicit task-list file (`tasks.toml` or `.md`) enumerating every atomic implementation step:
  - Each high-level phase broken into clearly enumerated, agent-ready tasks: e.g.
    - `[X] Implement GPU aggregation shader "agg_sum.comp.glsl"`
    - `[ ] Implement event listener for CSV Imports in engine thread`.

### 3. **Test & Benchmark Scaffolding**
- Concrete test scaffold crates (criterion.rs setup, test runners) provided upfront
- Define test fixtures explicitly (path references, sizes, expectations):
  - CSV test files pre-placed explicitly in repository root (static resources)
- Performance thresholds defined clearly (e.g., "10M rows aggregated/rendered < 50ms")

## 🧠 Explicit Inputs & Guidance Expected for Automation Agents

### 1. **Concrete Error & Edge Case Specifications**
- Exactly document anticipated edge cases (file lock scenarios, DuckDB behavior under memory pressure, GPU upload limits).
- Provide explicit error handling strategies:
  - Retry logic limits, exponential batching limits, exact logging/error reporting rules.

### 2. **Explicit Definition of External Dependencies & Bindings**
- Clarify FFI bindings and crates used (exact Rust crate choice for DuckDB interaction).
- Egui/Wgpu/GPU integration explicitly documented through example code-samples:
  - Agent typically expects a fully functional “hello-world” GPU example with egui's wgpu renderer clearly spelled out.

---

## 🚨 Missing Pieces Currently Unclear (Must Clarify Before Automation)

1. **Exact GPU Data Aggregation Algorithms Spec**
   - Currently vague without pseudocode or mathematical precision about how exactly to dramatically aggregate 10M points → GPU at each zoom level.

2. **Concrete Node Serialization Contract**
   - How nodes explicitly serialize to RON and deserialize. Currently left implicit:
     - Define explicitly (field by field) serialization structure in `SerializedNode` via Rust struct examples directly in-document.

3. **Robust Error Handling Strategy**
   - Current plan implies errors; there's no explicit map for an agent to follow:
     - Define exactly error values returned by each component (`enum AppError`, specific semantic error variants).

4. **Concrete Implementation Examples for Key Traits & Interfaces**
   - The provided pseudo-Rust trait definitions don't include enough concrete example implementations. 
   - Provide a minimal yet complete sample node implementation (`TableNode`, `QueryNode`, `PlotNode`) explicitly in-document as a template for agent replication.

## 🛠️ Suggestions for Enhanced Automatable Implementation 

### 1. **Implementation Recipes (Concrete Examples per Task)**
- By creating explicit, small, fully implementable agent recipes directly in the document:
  - e.g., "How exactly agent should wire an egui widget into wgpu rendering precisely", ordered steps documented explicitly.

### 2. **Comprehensive Implementation Checklists**
- An explicitly elaborate, step-by-step implementation checklist table alongside each planned component:
  - GPU renderer: "✔️ WGPU setup working", "❌ Compute shader missing".
  - Query engine: `"✔️ Execute basic DuckDB SQL query"`, `"❌ CSV import via DuckDB not yet tested"`

### 3. **Detailed Performance Criteria & Metrics Documented**
- Exactly specify per-operation performance & accuracy metrics clearly documented (fraction of cache hits expected, memory usage expectations) to allow autonomous monitoring and verification during agent-driven implementation.
