I'm sharing this `final_template_plan_v2.md` not for critique, but to determine what else needs to be prepared before a powerful automation agent (e.g. in Cursor) can begin implementing it.

Please give me a precise and implementation-focused assessment of:

- What *additional documents*, diagrams, specifications, or design clarifications are needed to fully scaffold and delegate this project to an agent
- Any missing pieces that would prevent a capable dev agent from confidently executing this plan
- Any suggestions for *structuring* the implementation environment (e.g. crate layout, initial entry points, task queues)
- What inputs or guidance an agent might expect that aren't yet spelled out
- Only suggest things that serve the goal of making this ambitious plan *more automatable and executable* — do **not** re-raise questions about simplifying, changing, or deferring features

For context:
- This is an offline-first, performant desktop application called **Pika-Plot**, written in Rust with `egui`, targeting Windows 10/11.
- It must be GPU-accelerated (assumes discrete GPU), interactive, able to handle millions of rows, and support both a notebook view and a canvas-based flow editor from day one.
- No phased rollout, no server or web features, no step-by-step build-up — full feature scope is expected from the start.
- I already have a working SQLite viewer built in Rust with egui and another codebase that implements many common plots. These could be reused or adapted.
- All requirements and decisions in the attached document should be treated as hard constraints unless explicitly marked as flexible.

Finally: please make your answer **thorough but scoped**. Focus only on what’s needed to make this project fully automatable, not hypothetical feature expansions or rethinking the architecture. Let me know what remains unclear or underdefined.
