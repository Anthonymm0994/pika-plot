# üîç Architecture Review & Critique: Pika-Plot

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Storage & Data Handling Concerns

### **DuckDB Assumption (Hidden Complexity)**

**Assumption:**  
You assume DuckDB will efficiently handle millions of rows with instant responsiveness via Arrow interfaces, providing built-in data spilling that comfortably manages memory pressure without issues.

**Challenge:**  
DuckDB, while powerful, carries limitations‚Äîparticularly under Windows when interacting heavily through FFI. High workloads may incur more overhead than anticipated due to serialization overhead between DuckDB and Arrow and overhead inherent in DuckDB's own memory management mechanisms. Additionally, DuckDB‚Äôs automatic spilling and indexing tend to perform less predictably under rapidly changing interactive workloads. 

**Improvement:**  
- Introduce early load/stress-test simulations against DuckDB bindings.
- Consider a clear abstraction boundary (via traits) around storage engines earlier. This allows easy replacement or addition of alternative engines (DataFusion/Polars) without painful refactoring.
- Benchmark storage designs under realistic workloads and realistic data sets before committing purely to DuckDB.  

### **Semantic Cache Complexity**

**Concern:**  
Semantic caching based solely on SQL AST normalization assumes query semantics will match frequently. In data exploration workloads, subtle query tweaks are common, so cache hits may be less frequent than envisioned.

**Improvement:**
- Prioritize caching aggregate results or derived subsets at a data lineage level (i.e., table-level caching, partially aggregated cache) over perfect semantic cache matching.
- Abstract cache access through clear traits, making caching strategy pluggable. Evaluate incremental caching via base-query subsets rather than strict AST equivalence.

## üìà Query Engine Design

### **Overly Ambitious Semantic Fingerprinting**

**Assumption:**  
The architecture suggests deep normalization through AST-level matches gives meaningful cache hit improvements.

**Challenge:**  
Considerable complexities arise at deeper AST normalization (disambiguating joins/sorts/groupings). Such normalization is brittle in implementation, leading to potential bugs and opaque cache misses‚Äî**the tradeoffs likely won't justify the complexity**.

**Improvement:**
- Limit normalization ambitions. Use a simpler fingerprinting criterion: normalize casing, whitespace, and trivial syntax differences, but avoid deep predicate canonicalization unless benchmarks justify.
- Clearly benchmark simpler lexical fingerprinting alternatives (hashing stable query text after trivial normalization) before adding AST complexity.

## üé® UI / UX Weaknesses

### **Infinite Canvas UX Complexity**

**Assumption:**  
Users naturally benefit from an infinite canvas, allowing arbitrary arrangement of interconnected nodes.

**Challenge:**  
Infinite canvas architectures typically struggle with discoverability and orientation. Users commonly get lost, frustrated with navigation, or overwhelmed when multiple data sources, queries and plots create spaghetti-like visual complexity.

**Improvement:**
- Introduce hierarchical layouts or layered workspace/project metaphors (as seen in visual IDEs or Miro‚Äôs frames/grids for spatial organization).
- Provide explicit mechanisms (snap-to-grid, pinned mini-panels/memory anchors, or table-of-contents tree-views) to help navigation, reduce frustration, and preserve clarity.
- Add smart layout modes that intelligently arrange nodes (cluster related nodes, auto-optimize adjacencies).

### **Linked Brushing at Scale**

**Concern:**  
Linked brushing across multiple plots and millions of rows is computationally expensive and complex to scale. With multiple plots visible, even GPU-based rendering quickly becomes a bottleneck.

**Improvement:**
- Explicitly design brushing interactions as a separate channel from full-resolution plot rendering. Keep brushed data aggregations small and distinct from main render pathways.
- Consider aggregated brushing (highlight groups rather than individual points) to preserve speed at large scales.

## üóÇÔ∏è Modular Organization & Complexity

### **Excessive Crate Split**

**Concern:**  
The architecture currently proposes seven separate crates. While clear modular boundaries aid organization, excessive granularity may create friction in design iteration and slow initial prototyping.

**Improvement:**
- Initially consolidate `pika-core`, `pika-compute`, and `pika-storage` into a single crate at early prototyping stages. Refactor these into distinct crates only after clear stability and real need.
- Balance modular isolation with approachability and ease of debugging‚Äîdon't prematurely isolate before actual complexity and clear reuse scenarios demand it.

---

## üîÑ State Management & Reactivity

### **Overly Implicit Event-Driven Complexity**

**Concern:**  
The highly event-driven, async-heavy architecture (UI->Channels->Compute->Cache) can create hidden state explosion and debugging struggles, particularly due to event storms or race conditions in asynchronous logic paths.

**Improvement:**
- Establish explicit context-boundaries (producer-consumer limits, bounded channels, and flow-control backpressure mechanisms).
- Introduce more declarative state/reactivity models at UI levels (e.g., Redux-style immutable state/actions or rx-style reactivity) to clearly segregate side-effects from purely functional logic.
- Adopt comprehensive event-tracing mechanisms early‚Äîconsider OpenTelemetry or tracing crates to clearly visualize async timelines.

## üìê Thinking from Scratch (Alternative Architectural Proposal)

Consider a slightly revised, leaner architecture that prioritizes simplicity, explicitness, and fewer moving parts first:

```markdown
Canvas Workspace (UI)
 |
 V
Declarative Canvas State (Centralized, versioned Model)
 |
 V
Reactive Graph Executor
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DuckDB Query Executor (Async threads, limited pool)
   ‚îÇ      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Limited Semantic Cache (Table/query-level caching)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Plot Sampler & Aggregator (GPU-accelerated as proposed)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Adaptive LOD Renderer (GPU)
 |
 V
Unified Storage Engine Abstraction (DuckDB as default, DataFusion optional)
```

**Benefits to this simplified approach:**  
- Easier early debugging: fewer moving async parts, simpler state management.
- Explicit state snapshots simplify save/load/future collaboration strategies.
- More flexibility at transaction boundaries (easier undo/redo support).

---

## üì• Alternative UI Metaphors

- Consider a **"Storyboard-style" vertical/horizontal arrangement** (common in visual editors like video editing tools). Users naturally navigate vertically scrolling content or horizontally arranged data flows better than fully open infinite canvases.
- A layered or stacking-based metaphor ("card stacks") may also significantly aid user understanding‚Äîeach "card" is a meaningful step or summary visual.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Suggested Improvements (Implementation Considerations)

### Testing Strategy

- Replace reliance on heavy-weight integration tests early with lighter, fast-executing unit tests, snapshot tests (golden master), and property tests (`proptest`) to cover nuanced edge-cases cheaply.
- Add comprehensive benchmarks (criterion.rs) early on all cache approaches, especially around semantic fingerprinting and LOD strategies.

## üå©Ô∏è Hidden Assumptions Exposed:

| You Assumed                                              | My Alternative Understanding                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Infinite canvas always empowers exploration              | Infinite canvases often confuse and overwhelm users; alternative curated spatial metaphors (e.g., grids or layers) offer clarity. |
| Deep semantic cache matches frequently improve UX        | Small query differences are common in EDA; simple lexical filters provide better practical ROI. |
| DuckDB is reliably performant under constant FFI exchange| FFI/DuckDB interaction is tricky & less predictable; abstraction boundaries and pluggable alternatives earlier reduce risk. |
| Dividing into many crates simplifies development         | Premature crate-splits may add complexity without clear reusability benefits; merge initially & split later. |

## ‚è≥ Next Steps & Immediate Actions

1. **Prototype simpler query fingerprinting** before complex AST normalization.
2. **Benchmark DuckDB integration** under realistic EDA scenarios (millions of rows, complex filtering) soon.
3. **Rapidly prototype canvas UI alternatives** (storyboard, stack or layered metaphors) using egui components.
4. **Implement explicit tracing and state inspection methods** for async-heavy channels behavior.
