## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Strategy

### Parallel Development Tracks

**Track 1: Core Infrastructure**
- Developer A works on engine and caching
- Focus on data processing pipeline

**Track 2: UI Development**
- Developer B works on UI components
- Focus on user interaction

**Track 3: GPU/Visualization**
- Developer C works on rendering
- Focus on performance

### Daily Sync Points
- Morning: Review overnight CI results
- Midday: Integration testing
- Evening: Merge approved PRs

### Code Reuse Strategy

**From pebble**:
- CSV import dialog
- Table schema display
- File chooser integration
- Query result table widget

**From frog-viz**:
- Plot type implementations
- Color scale algorithms
- Axis calculation logic
- Legend generation

### Testing Approach

**Continuous Testing**:
- Unit tests with each commit
- Integration tests daily
- Performance benchmarks weekly
- Manual testing for UI/UX

**Test Data**:
- Small: 100 rows (unit tests)
- Medium: 10K rows (integration)
- Large: 1M rows (performance)
- Huge: 50M rows (stress tests)

## üìä Success Metrics

### Week 1-2: Foundation
- [ ] All crates compile
- [ ] Can import a CSV file
- [ ] Basic queries execute

### Week 3-4: Core Features  
- [ ] UI responds < 16ms
- [ ] Mode switching works
- [ ] Nodes can be created

### Week 5-6: Visualization
- [ ] 60 FPS with 1M points
- [ ] All plot types render
- [ ] GPU memory tracked

### Week 7-8: Polish
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] All exports working
- [ ] < 5 second startup

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: GPU driver compatibility
**Mitigation**: Test on multiple GPUs early

**Risk**: Memory usage with large datasets
**Mitigation**: Implement streaming where possible

**Risk**: DuckDB performance
**Mitigation**: Profile queries, add indexes

### Schedule Risks

**Risk**: Integration delays
**Mitigation**: Daily integration, feature flags

**Risk**: GPU shader complexity
**Mitigation**: Start simple, iterate

**Risk**: Windows-specific issues
**Mitigation**: Test on multiple Windows versions
