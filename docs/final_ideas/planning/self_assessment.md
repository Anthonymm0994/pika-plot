# Critical Self-Assessment & Cross-Agent Delegation Plan

## 🎯 Overview

After reviewing the comprehensive Pika-Plot documentation, I'm confident in the overall architecture and can implement most components. However, I recognize several areas where specialized expertise would strengthen the implementation.

## 🖥️ GPU & Graphics Domain

### My Blind Spots:
- **Low-level GPU memory optimization** - I understand the concepts but lack hands-on experience with DirectX 11/12 quirks
- **WGSL performance patterns** - My shader knowledge is theoretical, not battle-tested
- **GPU driver compatibility** - Limited exposure to real-world driver issues

### Questions for **Grok 4** (Systems/Performance):
1. "Given the aggregation.wgsl shader in `docs/final_ideas/technical/gpu/aggregation.wgsl`, can you optimize the memory access patterns for coalesced reads on older GPUs (GTX 900 series)? Specifically, should we use shared memory for the tile-based aggregation?"

2. "What's the optimal vertex buffer layout for scatter plots with 10M+ points on DirectX 11? Should we use interleaved attributes or separate buffers? How does this affect cache performance?"

3. "For the three-tier rendering strategy (direct/instanced/aggregated), what are the exact performance crossover points on mid-range GPUs? Should these thresholds be dynamic based on GPU memory?"

### Questions for **GPT-4.5** (Crate Research):
1. "Research current best practices for wgpu on Windows with DirectX 11 backend. Are there any known issues with wgpu 0.19+ on older Windows 10 builds? What about the `wgpu-hal` direct backend access?"

2. "Compare `naga` vs `spirv-cross` for WGSL to HLSL translation. Which provides better compatibility with older DirectX versions?"

## 💾 Storage & Data Processing

### My Blind Spots:
- **DuckDB edge cases** - Limited experience with its Windows-specific behaviors
- **Arrow memory alignment** - Theoretical understanding, not practical optimization
- **CSV parsing resilience** - Unaware of latest edge cases in real-world data

### Questions for **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (Technical Documentation):
1. "What are the latest DuckDB best practices for memory management on Windows? Specifically, how should we configure the memory_limit and temp_directory for machines with 8-32GB RAM?"

2. "Document the Arrow RecordBatch zero-copy patterns when interfacing with DuckDB. Are there alignment requirements we should enforce?"

### Questions for **Grok 4** (Performance):
1. "Design a lock-free ring buffer for streaming CSV rows from disk to DuckDB that minimizes allocations. Should work efficiently with Windows file I/O."

## 🎨 UI & Concurrency

### My Blind Spots:
- **egui performance limits** - Uncertain about exact breaking points
- **Channel selection** - Multiple async channel crates, unclear which is optimal
- **Windows event loop integration** - Limited experience with winit quirks

### Questions for **GPT-4.5** (Crate Discovery):
1. "Compare `tokio::sync::mpsc` vs `flume` vs `crossbeam-channel` for the UI-Engine communication pattern described. Consider both performance and API ergonomics. Any Windows-specific considerations?"

2. "Research egui performance optimization techniques for rendering 1000+ nodes in canvas mode. Are there any community patterns for viewport culling or LOD systems?"

### Questions for **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (Architecture Patterns):
1. "Analyze successful egui applications that handle similar scale (1000+ interactive elements). What patterns do they use for efficient immediate-mode rendering?"

## 🔧 Platform-Specific Concerns

### My Blind Spots:
- **Windows 7 compatibility** - Unsure of specific API limitations
- **High DPI handling** - Complex topic with many edge cases
- **Memory monitoring accuracy** - Windows memory APIs have subtleties

### Questions for **Grok 4** (Windows Systems):
1. "Implement a robust Windows memory monitor that accurately tracks both physical and virtual memory, handling edge cases like memory-mapped files and shared memory. Should work on Windows 7+."

2. "What's the most reliable way to detect available VRAM on Windows across different GPU vendors? Consider both dedicated and shared GPU memory."

## 📦 Implementation Scaffolds I Can Provide Now

### 1. GPU Abstraction Layer
```rust
// pika-core/src/gpu/traits.rs
pub trait PlotRenderer: Send + Sync {
    fn prepare_buffers(&mut self, data: &PlotData) -> Result<GpuBuffers>;
    fn render(&self, buffers: &GpuBuffers, target: &RenderTarget) -> Result<()>;
    fn supports_point_count(&self, count: usize) -> bool;
}

pub trait AggregationStrategy {
    fn aggregate(&self, points: &[Point], viewport: &Viewport) -> AggregatedData;
    fn supports_gpu(&self) -> bool;
}
```

### 2. Caching Layer Template
```rust
// pika-engine/src/cache/query_cache.rs
pub struct QueryCache {
    inner: moka::Cache<QueryFingerprint, Arc<RecordBatch>>,
    memory_monitor: Arc<MemoryMonitor>,
}

impl QueryCache {
    pub async fn get_or_compute<F>(&self, sql: &str, compute: F) -> Result<Arc<RecordBatch>>
    where 
        F: Future<Output = Result<RecordBatch>> + Send
    {
        // Implementation with memory pressure handling
    }
}
```

### 3. Event System Scaffold
```rust
// pika-core/src/events/mod.rs
pub struct EventBus {
    ui_to_engine: flume::Sender<AppEvent>,
    engine_to_ui: flume::Receiver<AppEvent>,
}

pub trait EventHandler: Send + Sync {
    type Event;
    fn handle(&mut self, event: Self::Event) -> Result<()>;
}
```

## 🔬 Assumptions to Stress-Test

### For **Grok 4**:
1. "The 2GB VRAM minimum assumes we can efficiently stream data to GPU. Validate this assumption with a stress test that simulates memory pressure."

2. "The three-tier rendering threshold (50k/5M points) might not be optimal. Create a benchmark to find real crossover points."

### For **GPT-4.5**:
1. "Research if the `moka` crate is still the best choice for LRU caching in 2024, especially for Arrow RecordBatches. Are there better alternatives?"

2. "The RON format for snapshots might have parsing performance issues with large workspaces. Research alternatives or optimizations."

## 🌊 Open-Ended Research Questions

### For **GPT-4.5** (Web Research):
1. "What are the latest patterns in Rust desktop applications for handling file associations on Windows? How can Pika-Plot register as a handler for .pikaplot files?"

2. "Research successful open-source data visualization tools built with Rust in 2023-2024. What architecture patterns are they using?"

3. "Find examples of production egui applications that implement both immediate and retained mode UI patterns. How do they handle the complexity?"

### For **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (Cross-Language Insights):
1. "Compare Pika-Plot's architecture with successful data visualization tools in other languages (e.g., Plotly Dash, Tableau). What patterns could we adapt?"

2. "Analyze how modern BI tools handle memory pressure with large datasets. Are there techniques we're missing?"
