# üöÄ Pika-Plot: Complete Project Overview

## Executive Summary

Pika-Plot is a high-performance, GPU-accelerated desktop application for interactive data exploration and visualization. Built with Rust and designed for Windows 10/11, it enables users to work with massive datasets (millions of rows) through an intuitive dual-mode interface combining the best of notebook-style analysis and canvas-based visual programming.

## üéØ Core Value Proposition

1. **Scale Without Compromise**: Handle 50M+ data points smoothly through intelligent GPU aggregation
2. **Dual Paradigms**: Switch seamlessly between guided notebook mode and freeform canvas mode
3. **Offline-First**: Complete functionality without internet connectivity
4. **Performance**: Discrete GPU acceleration for instant interactivity
5. **Simplicity**: Import CSV, query with SQL, visualize immediately

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Foundation

### Language & Framework
- **Rust**: For performance, memory safety, and reliable concurrency
- **egui**: Immediate-mode GUI with excellent performance
- **wgpu**: Modern GPU API for cross-platform graphics

### Data Processing
- **DuckDB**: Embedded analytical database for SQL queries
- **Apache Arrow**: Columnar memory format for efficient data handling
- **Custom GPU kernels**: WGSL compute shaders for massive data aggregation

### Architecture Pattern
- **Event-driven**: Clean separation between UI and engine
- **Actor model**: Engine runs on dedicated thread with message passing
- **Two-tier caching**: Query results + GPU buffers

## üìä Key Features

### Data Import
- Drag-and-drop CSV files
- Automatic type inference with override options
- Progress indication for large files
- Schema preview before import

### Query Capabilities
- Full SQL support via DuckDB
- SQL editor with syntax highlighting
- Query result caching
- Real-time execution feedback

### Visualization
- 15+ plot types from scatter to treemap
- GPU-accelerated rendering
- Adaptive detail levels based on zoom
- Interactive tooltips and selection

### Workspace Management
- Save/load complete analysis sessions
- Recipe-based snapshots (references data, doesn't embed)
- Export to various formats (PNG, SVG, CSV, JSON)

## üé® User Experience Design

### Dual-Mode Interface

#### Notebook Mode
- Linear, cell-based workflow
- Familiar for data scientists
- Markdown support for documentation
- Execution order tracking

#### Canvas Mode
- Visual node-graph interface
- Drag connections between nodes
- Mini-map for navigation
- Spatial organization of analysis

### Node Types
1. **Table Node**: Imported data sources
2. **Query Node**: SQL transformations
3. **Plot Node**: Visualizations
4. **Transform Node**: Visual data operations
5. **Export Node**: Output generation

## üöÄ Performance Strategy

### Three-Tier Rendering
1. **Direct** (< 50k points): Each point rendered individually
2. **Instanced** (50k-5M): GPU instancing for efficiency
3. **Aggregated** (> 5M): Compute shader density mapping

### Memory Management
- Monitoring with configurable thresholds
- Graceful degradation when approaching limits
- Clear user feedback on memory pressure

### Caching Strategy
- Simple LRU for query results
- GPU buffers cached only for visible plots
- Automatic eviction on memory pressure

## üîß Development Approach

### Crate Structure
```
pika-core/    # Shared types and traits
pika-engine/  # Data processing and caching
pika-ui/      # User interface components  
pika-app/     # Application shell
pika-cli/     # Command-line interface
```

### Key Dependencies
- `duckdb`: Analytical database
- `arrow`: Data format
- `egui/eframe`: GUI framework
- `wgpu`: GPU programming
- `tokio`: Async runtime

### Testing Philosophy
- 50% correctness tests
- 30% integration tests
- 20% performance benchmarks

## üéØ Target Users

### Primary Audience
- Data analysts working with large datasets
- Researchers needing interactive exploration
- Business analysts creating reports
- Anyone frustrated by Excel's row limits

### Use Cases
1. **Sales Analysis**: Explore millions of transactions
2. **Scientific Data**: Visualize experimental results
3. **Log Analysis**: Pattern detection in system logs
4. **Financial Data**: Time series and correlations

## üö´ Non-Goals

1. **No Cloud Features**: Purely offline operation
2. **No Collaboration**: Single-user desktop application
3. **No Web Version**: Native performance only
4. **No Real-time Streaming**: Batch processing focus
5. **No Integrated Graphics**: Discrete GPU required

## üìà Success Metrics

1. **Performance**: 60 FPS with 1M visible points
2. **Scalability**: Handle 100M+ row datasets
3. **Responsiveness**: < 100ms for common operations
4. **Reliability**: No data loss, graceful error handling
5. **Usability**: Intuitive without documentation

## üîÆ Future Possibilities

While not in initial scope, the architecture supports:
- Additional file formats (Parquet, JSON)
- More plot types and customization
- Plugin system for custom nodes
- Python integration for advanced analytics
- Multi-window support

## üéâ Project Philosophy

**"Make the impossible possible, the possible easy, and the easy elegant"**

Pika-Plot aims to democratize large-scale data analysis by removing technical barriers while maintaining professional-grade capabilities. Every design decision prioritizes user empowerment through performance and simplicity.
