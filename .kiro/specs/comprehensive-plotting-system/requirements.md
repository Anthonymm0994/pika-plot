# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The fresh project needs a comprehensive plotting system that implements all the visualization types that were available in the frog-viz project, but with proper functionality, interactivity, legends, and column labeling. Currently, most plot types in fresh are placeholder implementations that display "coming soon" messages. This feature will transform these placeholders into fully functional, interactive visualizations that leverage DataFusion's capabilities for efficient data processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to create fully functional basic 2D plots (bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, histograms, box plots, heat maps, violin plots), so that I can visualize relationships and patterns in my data effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a bar chart plot type THEN the system SHALL render grouped/stacked bars with proper categorical data aggregation
2. WHEN I select a line chart plot type THEN the system SHALL render connected data points with support for multiple series
3. WHEN I select a scatter plot plot type THEN the system SHALL render individual data points with optional color coding and size mapping
4. WHEN I select a histogram plot type THEN the system SHALL render frequency distributions with configurable bin sizes
5. WHEN I select a box plot plot type THEN the system SHALL render statistical distributions showing quartiles, median, and outliers
6. WHEN I select a heat map plot type THEN the system SHALL render color-coded matrix visualizations for correlation or density data
7. WHEN I select a violin plot plot type THEN the system SHALL render distribution shapes with kernel density estimation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to create statistical analysis plots (anomaly detection, correlation matrix, distribution plots), so that I can perform advanced data analysis and identify patterns or outliers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select an anomaly detection plot THEN the system SHALL highlight data points that deviate significantly from normal patterns
2. WHEN I select a correlation matrix plot THEN the system SHALL display correlation coefficients between multiple variables in a matrix format
3. WHEN I select a distribution plot THEN the system SHALL render probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to create specialized visualization types (3D plots, multi-dimensional plots, hierarchical plots, geographic plots, time series plots), so that I can analyze complex datasets with appropriate visual representations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select 3D scatter plot THEN the system SHALL render three-dimensional point clouds with rotation and zoom capabilities
2. WHEN I select surface 3D plot THEN the system SHALL render three-dimensional surface visualizations
3. WHEN I select parallel coordinates plot THEN the system SHALL render multi-dimensional data with parallel axis representation
4. WHEN I select radar chart THEN the system SHALL render multi-variate data in a circular format
5. WHEN I select Sankey diagram THEN the system SHALL render flow visualizations showing relationships between categories
6. WHEN I select treemap THEN the system SHALL render hierarchical data using nested rectangles
7. WHEN I select time series analysis plot THEN the system SHALL render temporal data with trend analysis capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all plots to have proper axis labels, legends, and interactive features, so that I can understand and explore my data effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view any plot THEN the system SHALL display properly labeled X and Y axes with column names
2. WHEN I view any plot with categorical data THEN the system SHALL display a legend identifying different categories or series
3. WHEN I hover over plot elements THEN the system SHALL display tooltips with data values and context
4. WHEN I interact with plot legends THEN the system SHALL allow me to show/hide specific data series
5. WHEN I use plot controls THEN the system SHALL support zooming, panning, and selection interactions
6. WHEN I configure plot appearance THEN the system SHALL allow customization of colors, markers, and styling options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the plotting system to efficiently utilize DataFusion for data processing, so that visualizations perform well with large datasets and complex queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL use DataFusion's columnar processing for efficient data aggregation
2. WHEN creating plots THEN the system SHALL leverage Arrow format for zero-copy data access
3. WHEN filtering or transforming data THEN the system SHALL push computations down to DataFusion query engine
4. WHEN handling multiple plot types THEN the system SHALL reuse query results efficiently across different visualizations
5. WHEN working with time series data THEN the system SHALL use DataFusion's temporal functions for date/time processing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent plot configuration and data binding across all visualization types, so that I can easily switch between different plot types for the same data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure column mappings THEN the system SHALL validate column compatibility with the selected plot type
2. WHEN I switch plot types THEN the system SHALL preserve compatible configuration settings
3. WHEN I save plot configurations THEN the system SHALL persist settings for future use
4. WHEN I load saved configurations THEN the system SHALL restore all plot settings and column mappings
5. WHEN data updates THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh all connected plots with new data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want error handling and validation for plot configurations, so that I receive clear feedback when plot requirements are not met.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select incompatible columns for a plot type THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages explaining the requirements
2. WHEN data is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL show informative messages instead of crashing
3. WHEN plot rendering fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and provide troubleshooting guidance
4. WHEN column types don't match plot requirements THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative plot types or data transformations
